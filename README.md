# GEOG_458_Final_Project

#### Project Idea and Project Significance
For the final project, our project idea is to examine the relationship between Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) basin locations and their overflow volume in comparison to the percentage of people of color within Seattle, Washington. As defined by Danielle Rhea in “What are Combined Sewer Overflows?”, CSO Basins are areas where combined sewer systems exceed the stormwater capacity and overflow into the surrounding bodies of water. This can pose significant issues as it can pollute nearby waters, which is both harmful to people and the environment. Additionally, this map is relatively simple and is a participatory map, which can pose problems as people may draw conclusions without performing external research. There may also be problems regarding the content that people contribute, since it may be difficult to moderate submissions.

#### Major Data Sources and Targeted Audience
Our datasets include GIS data from the City of Seattle identifying the areas with CSO basins and their recorded overflow per year. As well as data from the city of Seattle taken from the American Community Survey (ACS) and from the 2020 Census. By using these two datasets we hope we can further inform people of color about their neighborhoods and how CSO Basins overflow can impact their health. The health impacts from CSO Basin overflows tend to impact communities of lower-income and people of color. It is important that these communities that are disproportionately impacted have access to this information that can further impact their health. With this map we also hope that this information will help planners and policymakers to make informed decisions and see the communities that they serve. 

#### Primary Functions and Project Format
We hope to tell the story of our map through several key functions. First, interaction with the CSO basins will be an extremely important function. Hovering over a CSO basin will provide some identifying information to the user to help map navigation. Once the user clicks on the CSO basin, there will be a wealth of information available. Notably, there will be the annual overflow volume, the body of water that receives the flow from the basin, the frequency of overflows per year, and the real time overflow status.  Some additional features to help with navigation will be an informational sidebar and layer toggling. All of these in combination will work to tell the story of our map. 

#### Project Format
The project format is a participatory map. One of the main key functions of our map is highlighting stories and experience of individuals impacted and have faced sewer overflow in their communities. With continuous months of rain and western Washington being on the coastline, this impacts communities and individuals' health more than we think. We want to provide a voice and platform to those having to deal with sewer overflows to bring this environmental health concern to light. We hope that sharing their experience will bring more attention to this environmental health concern to stakeholders such as policymakers, local advocates, and nearby community leaders. The map will be projected in WGS84 and it will be centered on the city of Seattle. The map will be deployed on Heroku, this way users will be able to contribute and participate.


#### Multimedia 
The multimedia we will be using will be used in the info sidebar feature. Here, information regarding the overall project will be provided and will mainly serve to explain what CSO basins are and their effects on the nearby communities. Texts and articles from outside resources will be included, contextualizing how CSO basins affect people of color, as well as diagrams depicting how CSO basins function. A few sources that are planning to be used, along with the quotes we are interested in including are the following:
* “CSO’s affect the ecological health of our water bodies, lower property values, and pose a public health concern to residents who reside downstream of outfalls. CSO’s also have an outsized impact on environmental justice communities. Patrick’s testimony highlighted these disproportionate affects… has demonstrated an increased risk of exposure to sewage for low-income communities and communities of color.”(https://mysticriver.org/news/2023/11/6/myrwa-testifies-on-combined-sewer-overflows)
* “In 1992, nearly 80% of CSOs occurred in majority African-American and low-income areas. (8) In west Atlanta, concerns about the stench and safety risk from raw sewage spills in a local public park led residents near Utoy Creek to organize… Their lobbying prevented the construction of a new CSO facility on Utoy Creek and led to the separation of sewage pipes from stormwater runoff in the area near Utoy Creek and part of Proctor Creek, eliminating CSOs in that area. (8)” (https://sustainability.emory.edu/environmental-justice-and-sewage-pollution-in-atlanta/)

#### Inspiration
An existing project that we would like to learn from would be the Proximity to Combined Sewer Overflow-Impacted Waters in Philadelphia: A Geographic Information Systems Study to Explore Environmental Injustice | Environmental Justice project. This project uses GIS methods to study the inequitable exposure to environmental hazards, such as to landfills and highways to compare and contrast populations living near CSO-impacted waters and those living near non impacted waters in Philadelphia by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic variables. This project is important because this could offer us a method in studying the POCs exposed in the CSO area.
