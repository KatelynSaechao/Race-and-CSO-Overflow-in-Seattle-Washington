# Description of the Project 
Utilizing the skills and mapping techniques learned in GEOG 458, we explore the relationship between demographics and environmental impacts. More specifically the spatial distribution of people of color in Seattle relationship with the annual overflow of Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) basins.

The purpose of the map is to compare race in relation to CSO overflow volumes
within the Seattle area. This map serves as a participatory map and allows for
users to add their own comments and experiences regarding living or being near
places where CSO basins are located or places where CSO overflowing occurs.
