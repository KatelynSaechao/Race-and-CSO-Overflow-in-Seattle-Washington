### Data Processing and Cleaning

The datasets have been cleaned and processed by using QGIS. This allowed for data to be formatted in a cleaner, more easily understandable way with the attribute names, as well as ridding of some unnecessary ones that clutter the datasets. Some data, the [POC data](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::race-by-age-groups-b01001a-i/explore), had to be joined with other data because it did not contain any geospatial data. The [2020 Census Tract](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::2020-census-tracts-seattle/explore) data with geospatial attributes was used to join this race data, which is also collected from the 2020 Census so it would be accurately depicted. Additionally, the data was filtered when initially downloaded so only the 2020 data would be utilized from the Seattle jurisdiction. The data for the [CSO basins](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/deb3e78249bf41b48a2f53efdb6f704f_0/explore?location=47.597243%2C-122.330350%2C12.00) was also processed through QGIS, mainly to create point location data along with the polygon geospatial data so as to create another layer that may be easier to view and compare with the POC dataset.
